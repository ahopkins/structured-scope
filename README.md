# Structured Scope

The goal of this endeavor is to standardize and define the meaning, and usage of "scopes" for implementation in an authorization utility. It is [licensed](https://github.com/ahopkins/structured-scopes/blob/master/LICENSE) under the [CC0 1.0 Universal (CC0 1.0)

The purpose of "scoping" is to provide a pass/fail response to a request for permission on a defined resource to authorized clients having the requisite permission level. A common application would be for permissioning on protected resources, for example, on web requests.
